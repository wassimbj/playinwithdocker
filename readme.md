**This is a simple Nodejs server with a MySQL database, containerized with docker**

**If you have a ready Sql database, just import it and put it into the *"sql-data"* folder**  
`And one more thing, just cd into the docker folder and type in the cmd docker-compose up`  
`go to http://localhost:7000 and you shall see the server running`
